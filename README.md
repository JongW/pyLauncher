# pyLauncher
Mini launcher I made to make life easier for myself using python.

Failed project.

I felt that PyQt5 library was too big and even when compressed ended up with a file size of around 60mb with cz_freeze which lead to the
program launch being rather slow.
Perhaps its just because I don't know how to make it smaller.
Therefore I decided to stop working on this project and make a new iteration of the project using a more lightweight library.
